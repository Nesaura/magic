        <h1>About MAGIC</h1>
        <p>MAGIC is an international defensive alliance between 7 nations (Dushina, Pathonia, the ZU, Racken, Cozio, Ebrein and Southern Karafuto). Its goal is the mutual protection of nations from both internal and external threats. It was founded on March 16th, 2024 by Tsar Fluff of Dushina.</p>

        <p>MAGIC was originally a triple-alliance between Dushina, the ZU and Pathonia. But nations would later be added to the organisation, effectively making it one of the largest defensive alliances in the world.</p>
